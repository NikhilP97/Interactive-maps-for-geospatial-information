# Interactive maps for  geospatial information

After already having some experience in Java I thought it would be good if i could brush up on my fundamentals and also get a bit of insight as to how Objects work because i soon realized that although Java is Object Oriented i may still be using procedural programming. Hence i opted for this course on Coursera and this perfectly suited my need as it is an Intermediate course on Java though they do brush up on basics. 

To create this project, I'll be working with a package called Unfolding Maps, which is a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations. It was developed by Till Nagel and the team at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam along with other contributors.The project is separated into several parts, and there are project milestones as you work through the modules in the course.

The Learning outcomes are:

Build an interactive graphical program in Java

Design classes to make use of object-oriented programming paradigms

Explain inheritance and polymorphism and how each concept is applied in the creation of a Java GUI

Explain how event handling works in Java, and write event handlers to create an interactive program

Write and apply searching and sorting algorithms to manage large data sets

Find and fix errors (bugs) in code

Develop and use test cases to ensure correctness of a program

This is part 1 of a 5 course specialization in Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization taught by UC San Diego
